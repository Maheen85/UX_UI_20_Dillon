            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We were inspired by Paw Fund's mission and the incredible work they do in "helping people help their pets". Paw fund, while having a great purpose,lacks an up to date website.
                <br>We wanted to help create a more user-friendly and visually compelling online presence for Paw Fund.
            </p>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We will redesign PAW Fund's website to be a professional and appealing platform that provides resources for new and existing pet owners in a more categorized and easily navigable way. <br>
            This redesign will boost the draw of Paw Fund's site, and will allow users to easily access the resources they desire.</p>

                A user research and analysis plan is conducted to understand our market, our target groups, and discover opportunities and pain points. Our team discussed the users that we should target. We basically wanted to target anyone that has pet experience or ideally just started the pet ownership process.

                This is Nate and Nana which I have chosen in our user process. They just recently got their kitten Gato and felt that they were the best representation in our user research and analysis process.

            <p>Balance maintaining Paw Fundâ€™s identity while pushing forward the design vision. Researching Paw Fund and similar websites to supplement no design input/wishes from Paw Fund themselves. In the future we hope to here back from Paw Fund themselves but until then we can only wish them the best with their non profit. This has been our Paw Fund redesign.
